# building-js-in-js

One of my favourite ways to explore Javascript is to build core behaviour as though it didnâ€™t exist.

## How to use this project

1. Clone it
2. Make sure you're using Node 22 or above
3. Run `npm test` to make sure you're all set up properly (no npm install needed thanks to the built-in test runner)
4. Pick a function you want to work on from the `src` directory
5. Replace the core function with your own, (examples below)

## Example

If you're wanting to write your own implementation of `indexOf` you'll find a file something like this:

```
export default function createArrayFromItems (...items) {
  return {
    indexOf: Array.prototype.indexOf.bind(items) // replace this with your implementation
  }
}
```

To get the first test to pass with your own implementation you can update that to:

```
export default function createArrayFromItems (...items) {
  return {
    indexOf: function () {
      return 0
    }
  }
}
```
